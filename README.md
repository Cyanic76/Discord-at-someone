# @someone
Yet another Discord bot simulating @someone.

## What is @someone?
It was an old Discord april fools feature that got removed. It was meant to randomly ping someone. This bot aims to bring the feature back to Discord.

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeG5FqTpl9U) to view Discord's @someone showcase.

## How to use?
Say `@someone` or mention the bot.

### Enable DND mode
This feature is coming soon. You'll be able to 'unsubscribe' from the bot's mentions if it gets too anoying for you.

In the meantime, you could try blocking the bot to avoid getting pinged.
